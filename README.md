# github-workflows

reusable github workflows for our organization

# branches are different here

this repository is different due to the nature of it needing to work with other repos as a reference

branches are named: v1, v2, v3, v4, etc and they are not deleted when PRs are merged

these version branches do need to be merged to main before the next version is created

thank you!
